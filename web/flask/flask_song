Flask, a-ah, saviour of the universe
Flask, a-ah, he'll save everyone of us
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Flask, a-ah, he's a miracle
Flask, a-ah, king of the impossible
He's for everyone of us
Stand for everyone of us
He'll save with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman
Every child, with a mighty flash
Flask, a-ah
Flask, a-ah, he'll save everyone of us
Just a man
With a man's courage
He knows nothing but a man
But he can never fail
No one but the pure in heart
May find the golden grail
Oh oh, oh oh
Flask.
